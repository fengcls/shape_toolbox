# shape_toolbox
A collection of public and custom scripts used for shape analysis

1. external/toolbox_graph is from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/5355-toolbox-graph, more related matlab functions can be found in https://github.com/gpeyre/matlab-toolboxes

2. external/freesurfer is from https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/

3. other useful matlab toolboxes include:

  * [Iso2Mesh](https://github.com/fangq/iso2mesh): 3D surface and volumetric mesh generator
   
  * [SurfStat](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat/): Statistical analysis toolbox of surface data
   
  * [Poisson's equation solver](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~ygorelic/3DGMG_poisson_solver_basic.zip)

4. other useful command line tools include:

  * [Point Cloud Library (PCL)](http://www.pointclouds.org/):

  * [MeshLab](http://www.meshlab.net/ ): a powerful system processing and editing 3D triangular meshes. One can use the MeshLab to interactively filter the mesh and, save the filters for batch processing using meshlabserver
   
  * [Qhull](http://www.qhull.org/): convex hull, Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi diagram ...
